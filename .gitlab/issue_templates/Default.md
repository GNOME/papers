### Description

REPLACE-ME: more detailed description of the problem. If the problem happens on a specific document, please add a link or attach the document. If Papers is crashing, a backtrace is always useful. A good example would be: "I clicked on a link from Epiphany which opened Papers for viewing a PDF document. Papers crashed before actually rendering anything at all. Attached you can find the document and the backtrace after the crash"
