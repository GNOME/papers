Papers unreleased
=================

Papers has been forked from Evince, including the whole history of the
evince-next branch to which the authors of the fork contributed extensively.
Papers has landed the GTK4 port from Qiu Wenbo, many (breaking) cleanups to
both libraries, and a bunch of cleanups, modernizations and improvements to
the application itself. Among the changes, we can highlight:

libraries (libppsdocument, libppsview):
  * Due to the of modernization of these, all deprecated API has been removed.
    There have also been some API-breaking changes all around the code, mostly
    aimed at implementing new patterns. The goal of the authors is to reduce the
    public surface of the libraries. So please come in contact if you are a user
    and want to continue using the libraries long-term. We want to learn from
    your usage to provide a good and long-term maintainable experience.
  * The libraries no longer provide any icons or use any custom ones.
  * EvDocumentModel dual-page property has been removed
  * Transition backends to use a new interface for registration
  * Mark types as derivable or final as need be
  * Rename and deprecate EvJobs that do rendering based on cairo
  * Drop EvJobLoadStream and EvJobLoadGFile. Merge EvJobLoad and EvJobLoadFd
  * Some work on sanity of PpsJobs API.
  * GPU based transition of presentation mode with additional effects support.
    Transitions will no longer work if HW acceleration is not supported
  * Use GThreadPool for PpsJobScheduler. Many jobs can now run concurrently, and
    we no longer leak the thread memory.
  * PPS_PROFILE and PPS_PROFILE_JOBS environment variables for profiling are now
    ignored. Anybody wishing to profile papers can now use sysprof, which
    provides a far better interface.

shell:
  * Port to GTK4 thanks to the effort of Qiu Wenbo
  * Removed spell-checking feature. Hopefully will come back through libspelling
  * Implemented some new mockups for the first time in years (thanks Chris!)
  * Lots of small papercuts from the GTK4 migration and other widgets that had
    not received love in a while.
  * Many internal cleanups to use standard widgets, instead of showing and
    hiding internal widgets as different parts of the application change.
  * Ported many widgets to UI templates
  * Make the main widget of PpsWindow an AdwViewStack
  * Start rewriting the UI in Rust, and port several widgets (#21)
  * Rework the properties dialog with modern widgetry.
  * Fix dbus names to fit app id.
  * Drop the auto-scroll feature for maintainability reasons.

properties:
  * Can now be used in Nautilus again. Dropped GTK dependency

backends:
  * Dropped support for DVI file format. This is an old and seldomly used
    document format. The backend has lived unmaintained for many years, and
    we don't have the bandwidth or interest to maintain it. DVI documents
    can always be converted to PDF using Evince or other programs. If anybody
    in the community has a strong interest, they could always maintain an
    OOT backend, or come to us.
  * Dropped synctex support. This was planned to work together with gedit,
    that is no longer a Core App. And modern tex editors all have a PDF
    previewer built-in. So there's no need to duplicate that work when we
    cannot maintain a copy of the synctex library internally.

Of course, all this does not come without some issues, so we have likely
regressed in some aspects. We look forward to testers and gathering feedback.
